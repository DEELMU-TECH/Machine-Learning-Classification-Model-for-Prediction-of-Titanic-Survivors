    "## Here, we are verifying the datatypes to ensure you get all the categorical data types. No preprocessing activities will be done on the categorical data, CatBoostClassifier will handle all of that to change the categorical data to numerical data to be used by the classification algorithm. \n",
    "## Categorical data in simple terms refers to data that refers to specific categories signified by words thus they can be converted to numeric data. words like \"yes\",\"no\" and \"maybe\" are converted to 1, 2 and 3 instead. Machine Learning algorithms use mathematical calculations to calculate the predicitions behind the scenes so they need numbers to work, herego the \"yes\", \"no\" and \"maybe\" data is changed to numbers to be able to be used in the mathematical equation."
